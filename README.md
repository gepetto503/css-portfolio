## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

## Specs

* _navbar sticks to the top of the window as you scroll and allows you to click to any section.  on mobile view, navbar collapses to menu button._
* _responsive gallery section made using flexbox._
* _hero text fades as you scroll._
* _name in navbar has an animation triggered by scrolling past the hero image that draws your attention to it (because the text on the hero image is for visual effect and not entirely readable.  the intent is for the viewer to think "i can't quite read that, what does it say?" and then when they scroll down they go "oh it's Brendan Hanna.  that guy's a beast.")._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
