# _Brendan Hanna Portfolio Website_

#### _Portfolio website for web designer/front end developer Brendan Hanna, June 2017_

#### By _**Brendan Hanna**_

## Description

_This website is designed to showcase my web design projects while incorporating my current html/css/javascript skillset: SASS, Bourbon, Jquery, animations and transitions, flexbox, media queries, and more!_

## Specs

* _navbar sticks to the top of the window as you scroll and allows you to click to any section.  on mobile view, navbar collapses to menu button._
* _responsive gallery section made using flexbox._
* _hero text fades as you scroll._
* _name in navbar has an animation triggered by scrolling past the hero image that draws your attention to it (because the text on the hero image is for visual effect and not entirely readable.  the intent is for the viewer to think "i can't quite read that, what does it say?" and then when they scroll down they go "oh it's Brendan Hanna.  that guy's a beast.")._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

## Support and contact details

_{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}_

## Technologies Used

_{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}_
